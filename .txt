CONSULTING:
Woman speaks to people across desk
Leaders aren’t born, they’re formed—and meaningful, results-driven leadership development doesn’t just happen.

That’s where we come in: We are proud to partner with leading organizations to create and deliver robust leadership development programming designed to drive results.

All of our leadership development products and services, whether they are delivered virtually or in person, are grounded in the skills, knowledge, 
and thoughtfulness of our team of world-class consultants.

We are committed to delivering the very latest in the leadership development thinking. Our consultants have an average of 15+ years of business experience,
giving them the real-world experience needed to serve as your committed leadership partner.

Here’s how a partnership with Linkage works:
Expert Analysis from Expert Consultants
We don’t come to the table with assumptions or preconceived notions about your business or your needs. Instead, we ask the right questions—about your goals,
your available resources, and your unique needs. Then, we conduct the in-depth analytical work necessary to make informed recommendations about the future of 
leadership at your organization.

Deploy Best-in-Class Assessment and Diagnostic Tools
We make use of best-in-class assessment tools that provide us with targeted data about your organization’s leaders, allowing us to build a leadership 
development program grounded in reality—instead of simple assumptions about your leadership ranks. Our team of consultants are experts in both the delivery 
and debriefing of our 360° and organizational assessments. We’ve combined 30+ years of insights into these assessments, and the results show. One example 
of the Linkage difference? Our Advancing Women Leaders Organizational Assessment is the only diagnostic tool available that is specifically written with 
women leaders in mind—and will actively predict whether you can retain high-performing women leaders.

The Right Programming, Tailored to Your Organization
At Linkage, we understand that every organization faces its own unique challenges—from building a diverse pipeline of leaders to retaining the very
 best of your workforce—which is why we tailor our delivery to fit your goals and needs. Work with our expert consultants to thoughtfully integrate 
our solutions, products, and assessments into your existing leadership development programming, and use our tools to help you achieve your goals.

Thought Partnership, When You Need It
Here’s a truth we understand: Human resources, talent development, organizational development, and executive leaders are responsible for accelerating 
the development of their leaders. But, they’re also responsible for telling a story about their work to identify, develop, and retain these leaders.
To tell a compelling story, they need access to critical data on their own organization—and they also need insights into the state of leadership as a whole. 
We provide both, along with the expert insight you need to synthesize and analyze the data and take tangible steps forward.
